Turkcell GeleceÄŸi Yazanlar Swift Bootcamp PuanlÄ± Final Ã–devi
## Features

- The project follows the VIPER (View-Interactor-Presenter-Entity-Router) design model, which makes the components of the application independent and increases testability.
- Unit Test and UI Test were written with the help of protocols by increasing testability with VIPER architecture.
- Every area that can overflow in the application is designed using AutoLayout to take dynamic size. It can run smoothly on devices with different screen sizes.
- The internet connection of the device is controlled with the NetworkManager package on the Splash screen. User redirections are made according to the situation.
- A loading indicator is displayed during data loading. This visually shows the user that the data is loading and improves the waiting experience.
- A customized ToastMenu plugin was written for error and warning messages for user experience.
- Created a CoreData class called FavoriteManager for adding and managing songs to favorites.
- A Custom View called PlayerView was created to be used on the MusicCell and detail page on the search page. This structure was supported with AudioManager.
- The AudioManager package has been updated and made more comprehensive. It can be used in MusicCell and detail page in PlayerView structure.
- Favorites page has been added to manage songs added to favorites. Favorite songs can be edited on this page.
